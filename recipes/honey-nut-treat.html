    <h2>Sweet balls made of nuts and honey</h2>
    <p>Woah weary traveler, thanks for walking into my inn. I have plenty of food and drink in stock if you fancy yourself an ale or if you'd rather I can whip you up some of my famous Honey Nut Treats. This treat is nuts in various forms, honey, and simple cereals for any traveler to take a break with. Simple, nutritious and tasty.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>40g (about a handful) mixture of nuts (walnuts, haelnuts, cashews)</li>
        <li>30g peeled unsalted peanuts</li>
        <li>60g dry oatmeal</li>
        <li>3 tbsps multiflower honey</li>
        <li>3 tbsps peanut butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut nuts roughly into smaller pieces â€“ walnuts into quarters, hazelnuts and cashews in half.</li>
        <li>Add honey and peanut butter to the saucepan. Heat on low power for about 1 minute, stirring constantly. When the mass becomes smooth and combined, turn off the heater.</li>
        <li>Put nuts, peeled peanuts and oatmeal into a warm honey mass. Mix everything thoroughly. When the mixture has cooled down a little, put it under the cover for 30 minutes in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Take mass out of the fridge and form balls of various sizes, which should be put on sticks. Chill them in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with an additional potion of butter and powdered sugar.</li>
        <li>Remove Honey Nut Treat from fridge about 30 minutes before serving. It goes well with a mug of dark,bitter beer.</li>
    </ol>
